**Principles of Programming Languages BITS Pilani**

This repository contains my submission for the assignment completed as part of the PPL Course (CS F301) offered 1st semester 2018-2019.

The goal is to implement a CNN using only functional programming paradigm of Scala. The file CNN.scala implements this. We were required to implement only the feed-forward part. The specifications can be found in PPL Assignment.pdf

To execute (in the project directory):
1. Run ***scalac CNN.scala driver.scala*** to compile the code.
2. Run ***scala pplAssignment.Driver t*.in > t*.check*** to produce the output.
3. Run ***diff t*.check t*.out*** to compare against the expected output.
